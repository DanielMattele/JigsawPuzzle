# JigsawPuzzle

With my Jigsaw Puzzle game, you can load your own image or choose one ofthe examples to turn it into a jigsaw
puzzle. You can choose the shape and the number of your pieces and whether you want them to be rotatable or not.
In the GUI, the pieces can be dragged (or rotated) by clickingthem. When you put two pieces close enough together,
they are merged and will be dragged (or rotated) together from here on. The game is finished, when all pieces are merged.

This game was developed using Qt Creator 7.0.0, based on Qt 6.2.3 (MSVC 2019, 64 bit)
